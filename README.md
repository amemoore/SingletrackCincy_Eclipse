WIP - Application to pick a mountain bike trail based on location and difficulty of trail.  
Web-based pplication will allow user to select a park and then the appropriate trail.  User will also be able to search for the 
type of trail such as "intermediate".
Working on Eclipse Neon. Using JSP and Servlets for web interaction with user and MySQL will be used on the backend.
